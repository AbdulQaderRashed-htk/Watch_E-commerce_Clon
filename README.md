# Watch E-Commerce Website âŒš

This is a practice project I built for my portfolio to simulate a simple e-commerce website for watches.  
The goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with front-end development, layout design, and styling.

## Features
- Home page with hero section
- Product catalog displaying different watches
- Product detail cards with descriptions and prices
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Simple navigation and clean design

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Flexbox & Grid for layout)

## Purpose
This project was created purely for **learning and practice**.  
It is not a full-fledged e-commerce application (no backend, no payment system).  
All product images and details were sourced online for **educational use only**.

## Future Improvements
- Add JavaScript for interactivity (cart, filters, search)
- Connect to a backend for real product data
- Improve accessibility and SEO
